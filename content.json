Yangtze could be tranquil as a pond while at times fierce as the raging ocean. One day his sword fell overboard and disappeared into the muddy rapids. To save his treasured companion the swordsman swiftly notched the skiff with a knife to mark the position where the sword had fell. When he finally managed to stablize and stop the boat, he dived right at the position of the notch to salvage his sword. His efforts were in vain after all. Yangtze had carried the skiff away since he carved the notch. The sword was now with Yangtze forever. Notching Skiff to Retrieve Sword (刻舟求劍 kè zhōu qiú jiàn) is a story from Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals 呂氏春秋 . It has been told so many times over the centuries that eventually, it became an idiom in the Chinese language for describing the ill-fated efforts by dim-witted people. I have a different understanding. Notching Skiff to Retrieve Sword is a story about life and loss. At some point in our life, things we treasured are bound to be lost, like being taken away by the Yangtze, and never to re-emerge. What is lost in time is lost. Notching our skiff is perhaps the best way to remember it. Life is only meaningful thanks to memory. Through memory we travel upstream the river of time and relive the past, diving again and again into the moments that once shined vivid and bright. In a sense, as long as we can remember them, they are not totally gone. Memory, or notching the skiff, is the ONLY means to “retrieve” the lost sword. Nine-dragon Well, 九龍井, was an old well in Wuchang. Back in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) it was a well with an elaborate relief of nine dragons carved on its surface, situated inside the rear garden of the palace of Imperial Prince Chu 楚王, who governed his vast fiefdom from there. In 1643, the last Prince Chu was executed by rebels. The palace was sacked and then burnt to the ground. Nine-dragon Well was probably one of the few things that survived the turmoil. In the centuries that followed, a namesake settlement flourished around the well. Nine-dragon Well continued to exist as an old, quiet neighbourhood in central Wuchang. From 1991 to 1998 I spent most of my teenage years in this neighbourhood. I went to Nine-dragon Well Primary School. All my friends and most classmates lived here. Day and night we made its streets, parks and the maze of small alleys our playground. I attended junior high at a place two hundred metres away from it. My senior high was further one mile away. Then I went to college, thousands of miles away, in a coastal province. Then I found a job in Beijing. My adult life mostly took place elsewhere, and my parents moved out of the old neighbourhood in 2002. But it remained as a witness to my past and many cherished memories. But modern urbanisation finally caught up with old Wuchang. While I was away many old residential buildings were bulldozed and redeveloped. A major city arterial road was constructed right through the middle of the neighbourhood. A metro line was constructed and a metro station named 彭劉楊 was built at the heart of the Nine-dragon Well. The old well itself was now covered by structures. I dedicate this tiny cyberspace to you, 九龍井."}],"posts":[{"title":"Preface for Book of Liang in Modern Chinese

近一年多来一直在做的项目，《梁书今译》*，今年有望出版，自为译序，以志初心。 ​ 《梁书》为“二十四史”之一，是一部记载我国南北朝时期南朝梁代（502-557）史事的纪传体断代史。与司马迁《史记》、班固《汉书》相似，《梁书》也是一部凝结两代史学家心血的史书。它由姚察、姚思廉父子相承编纂修撰，成书过程颇为曲折，历梁、陈、隋、唐四朝，前后耗时近八十年，于唐贞观十年（636）才告修成，成书次年姚思廉即病逝。这部史书的编修耗时，已超过其所记朝代之历年。 ​ 南朝梁，亦称萧梁，是南朝的第三个朝代。它享国不足一甲子，又承续了永嘉之乱以来中国南北分裂对峙的基本格局，但一改宋齐皇室相残、废立频仍的乱象，于北方政权内部动荡、战乱纷起之际，保持了中国南方数十年政局的大体稳定，社会经济获得发展，文化艺术、思想学术等领域更是出现了前代未有的繁荣景象，后世史家评价其“自江左以来，年踰二百，文物之盛，独美于兹”（《南史·梁本纪》）。尽管常常被夹在南北朝中贴上“乱世”的标签，萧梁实是汉唐之间历史天空中一抹短暂而绚烂的华彩。 ​ 《梁书》共五十六卷，含本纪六卷：《武帝纪》三卷，《简文帝纪》一卷，《元帝纪》一卷，《敬帝纪》一卷；列传五十卷：第一记七位后妃生平，第二记三朝太子事迹，第十六记太祖五王（武帝的五位兄弟），第十七记长沙嗣王等武帝诸侄，第二十三记高祖三王（武帝的三个儿子），第三十八记太宗十一王及世祖二子，第四十九记宗室悖逆者，末卷详述侯景之乱，其余列传在单传、合传之外尚有类传八卷——《孝行传》一卷、《儒林传》一卷、《文学传》二卷、《处士传》一卷、《止足传》一卷、《良吏传》一卷、《诸夷传》一卷。 ​ 姚察父子编修《梁书》，主要取材于国史，又博采梁、陈、隋历代史家如谢炅、许亨、何之元、刘璠等所著梁史，“编次笔削”而成。姚察本身是《汉书》名家，遍览坟籍，博闻强识，姚思廉从小接受汉史传授，尽传家业。《梁书》拣择精练，用墨简洁，列传采取类叙之法，而且经常较完整地引用诏书、奏议，这些特点都反映出姚氏父子对《汉书》等经典史乘体例的有意识的继承。清《四库全书总目提要》在评价《梁书》史论与编排时说它“持论多平允，排整次第，犹具汉晋以来相传之史法，要异乎取成众手，编次失伦者矣”，这个评价是很准确的。 ​ 尤值一提的是，虽然《梁书》创作于文体普遍骈俪化的时代，姚察父子在书中除引文之外，叙事议论大都采用散体，凝练古朴，行文爽劲。《卷六》末尾，监修官魏征总结梁朝兴亡得失的论赞文字仍取骈四俪六的形式，两相对比，可以见出姚氏父子在史传文体文风上的独到追求。正因如此，清代史学家赵翼在《廿二史札记》中赞誉“《梁书》虽全据国史，而行文则自出炉锤，直欲远追班、马”，并将姚氏史著视为中唐古文运动的先声。 ​ 译者长期从事跨文化传播与翻译工作，这部《梁书今译》，是译者在汉语古籍今译方向上的初次探索。在翻译过程中，深深感到汉语古籍今译是一项貌似基础而实则具有很高门槛的工作。今译的出发点在于普及，但今译的前提是对古籍文本完整而准确的理解，如果做不到，则今译之“信”就无从谈起。这就对译者的知识储备和学术功底提出了很高的要求。可以说，古籍今译本身也是学术研究的一个环节，有着很强的学术性。同时，一部优秀的古籍今译作品，还必须在准确理解原始文本的前提下，对译文进行创造性的塑形和打磨，追求“达”和“雅”。在这方面，古籍今译也遵循所有语种翻译工作的普遍规律，也需要灵活采用“归化”、“异化”两种策略，力求用晓畅得体的现代汉语传递出文言古籍的文学特性与文体格调。译者水平所限，错漏疏失之处在所难免，恳请读者方家不吝赐教指正。 ​ 汉语是一条古老而美丽的河流。几千年来，她历经改道，过去的百年中，她的样貌和生态尤多嬗变改观，蓄纳了许多新的水体，滋养着更加广众的人群。愿我们的今译工作，能开浚一条通往上游故道的清流，帮助读者领略她博大幽深的风景，并唤醒对这条长河的珍惜。 ​ 二〇二四年一月十五日 ​

将近除夕时，在市场的水产区买了一条大草鱼。 拿抄网从玻璃缸中的鱼群里面捞出一条大小相宜且面善的草鱼，交给摊主讲定就买这条，他就把鱼放在地面上，用一根大棒对准鱼脑后咚地来了一下。《老人与海》里面，古巴渔民捕了鱼也是这么棒杀。听那声结结实实的闷响，脑骨应该都裂了。嘴角和鳃都流出鲜血来，鱼当即就不再扭动。 我看着地面，默默感恩鱼儿牺牲生命换来我们的餐食。 过秤计价，另一个专管加工的熟练师傅就帮我去鳞。因为是做烤鱼，鱼的切法略有不同，我不愿意烦劳他人，就嘱咐了，除了刮去鱼鳞，其余都不必动，我带回去自己料理。 师傅真是大手笔，鳞片纷飞，过程当中血又流了不少。待到鱼儿装进袋里交给顾客，已经不怎么滴血，鱼也老老实实的。暗暗松了一口气。其实我最怕的就是鱼儿在我手里死命挣扎，平时买活鱼比较少也是这个原因。 两斤多的这么一条草鱼，才十四元，生活在江湖际会河鲜云集之地还是有些好处的。 回到家先在水槽边磨了磨刀。失去生命的鱼儿安静地卧在一旁，霍霍声中我忽然觉得，那些肢解尸体再吃掉的变态杀人狂，恐怕都很痴迷这一时刻的安详吧。啊幸好我不是！不能再胡思乱想，对鱼儿实在太失礼了。 磨好刀，先挖去鱼鳃，切下鱼头和尾段，洗净挂起在一旁沥水。剪去胸腹鳍之后，用刀从鱼背中线切到脊柱，逐根剪断肋刺，鱼身就这么从背部打开了，鱼肚连接起剖为两片的鱼身，内脏完好无损。清理完内脏和腹腔的黑膜，鱼身就处理好了。 鱼头和尾段做了鱼汤，奶白鲜香，我妈赞不绝口。鱼身腌制入味后进烤箱做了年饭的大菜烤鱼，表皮焦酥味足，下面是雪也似的鱼肉，带着烧烤食物特有的香气。家人极少吃烧烤，味蕾不太习惯外层调料的密集轰炸。我也很少吃烧烤，却因此而很喜欢这道菜。真要感谢小高姐的分享。 鱼儿的生命转化成为我们的一部分，它也因此而存留在了曾经自由周游过的世间，未曾虚度鱼生。 和草鱼一起买的还有一条羊前腿。今年羊肉价格低迷，养殖户也很难吧。我很少整条买羊腿，发现现在市售的羊腿大都连着一截脊骨来卖，这样利润应该能更高一些。 整腿买回来，用尖刀大致分解出骨肉来。一部分羊肉肥瘦搭配做了新疆风味的烤包子。 这种美食从北非中东直到中亚都很流行，各国语言对它的叫法都差不多，近似“索姆萨”，大都做成尖角形，也有圆的方的。新疆烤包子似乎以方形居多。小区后面有家没招牌小门脸的疑似新疆饭馆在门外搭起一个馕坑，有烤包子卖，但是做的相当偷工减料，比起我在乌鲁木齐吃过的差了不止一个等级。 其实烤包子完全可以用烤箱自己在家做，是家用烤箱做起来非常方便又不容易翻车的上佳选择，惟揉面调馅需几分耐心而已。 烤包子的皮要酥脆，面团里最好加入一层油酥，不过据我测试，每350克面粉混入50克植物油再揉面，面皮擀得稍薄些，做出来也能酥脆掉渣，只是没有“千层”效果而已。 喜欢烤包子还因为它既能当正餐，也能配奶茶作下午茶点心。两种用途都是趁热吃最香，每次吃烤包子我总会烫着嘴。今年我烤好一批后飞速骑车送到我姐那里，结果大受欢迎。 一部分羊腿肉跟胡萝卜一起红烧，是数九寒天的好菜。我家婆婆（外婆）在世时，过年前后最冷的时候很爱吃热气腾腾的胡萝卜烧羊肉。 带棒骨的羊小腿，腌制之后进烤箱烧烤，外皮香脆而香透肉中，烤好后家人围坐用小刀分吃。刚毕业在北京工作时，常和可爱多去对外经贸大学的菊园餐厅吃饭，饭菜的价格不高但都很可口。他家的烤羊小腿十五元一只，烤得非常好吃，几乎是我们必点的项目，不知今在否。 剩下的带肉扇骨和脊骨都做了清炖羊汤。这是一只肉质鲜嫩的好羊。 吃羊肉时我总结了这条羊腿的做法，老妈感叹道，羊真是好，全没有浪费的地方。我说是啊，羊毛羊绒羊皮羊肉羊奶，游牧民族的生活就围绕着羊打转呢。 羊之于游牧民族，正如谷麦之于农耕民族，皆衣食所仰也。它们是神派遣到世间的使者，负责大地生命的转化。 庖厨之室，是这种转换过程在千家万户发生的地方，虽然不免腥污油腻，可以说性质与神庙殿堂并无不同。君子可不敬慎待之乎？","categories":[{"name":"WhatsCooking","slug":"WhatsCooking","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/categories/WhatsCooking/"}],"tags":[{"name":"food","slug":"food","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/tags/food/"}]},{"title":"A

That gave me great relief, because they REALLY are a perfect match and to see people like them miss each other out would definetely break my heart. I sent a little gift to the new parents and 輝, who is a talented barista, sent me two packs of freshly roasted coffee beans. He knew I’m a coffee drinker. I haven’t visited his cafe Old House yet, which he co-founded with friends after his previous cafe business, a cafe joint on a mini-van called STAY Coffee Bus, ceased to operate following some rifts between him and the investor. I was a fan of STAY. In 2017 when I visited them I spent half a day with 輝 working in this little cafe bus. It was something that you can call a “dream”.

Their heterogeneous confederations usually consisted of a variety of tribal groups, whose cultures and customs spread across the steppe and then, when their states and dynasties were no more, simply merged into the latecomers’. Sometimes I wonder if this would be a cleaner, happier way of existence - no need to learn how to write. For your relatively short life expectancy, just speak what you think, and let the next wind carry it away. No diary, no blog. No journalism, no tomes of classics and no exam papers for the kids. No glory to pass down. No lies to repeat. When night falls and bonfire rises, you sing. When you die, your songs might be sung by neighbours and children, or not. Clans and generations, great loves and legendary warriors, all disappear after one or two blizzards in the history. Really clean. This, understandably, posed a challenge to the preserving of history record and literature. A strange hobby of some compulsive obsessionists, no doubt. But there was always the Han Chinese. Boy did we love writing. We worshipped it, creating different forms of scrips, making many an arts and inventions for it. To be able to write was like to be able to interpret ancestors and saints, gods and emperors. Thanks to the records of the Han Chinese, some cultural traces of the disappeared nomads were preserved. Such as the folk songs of the Northern Dynasties (386 - 581 CE) 北朝民歌. They are mostly ballads of Xianbei people, singing about wars, steeds, young lovers and scenery of the north, and were dutifully collected by the music department (called Yuefu 樂府) of the Southern Dynasties established by the Han. Compared to the folk songs in the south, which were often sung by female singers using many puns and metaphors, these northern songs are distinctively less feminine, much bolder and more straightforward. (Poem of Mulan 木蘭詩 is one celebrated example.) The nameless Yuefu translators did their job well and skilfully. Centuries later, we can still recite these beautiful lyrics, even chant them in rhythm, enjoying the vivid images they inspire. But please bear in mind - they are mostly results of Han translators’ rendition. The original ballads were sung in the tongue of the nomads, who loved singing in their lifetime so much that, they didn’t bother to entrust their songs to any form of writing. I understand and respect that. Life is short. Sing. Here goes my rendition of a handful of these northern songs: Songs of Picking Willow Branches (Translator’s note: according to an old Chinese tradition, willow branches, a token of sadness and lingering thoughts, were often presented as a farewell gift between loved ones or friends) ~ Time to bid goodbye. I mounted my horse ~ Instead of a whip, I reached for a branch of willow ~ On top of the saddle I crossed my legs. Sound of long flute gently flew ~ How many roads could a traveller ride down, before he was crushed by his sorrow (sung by rider’s wife) ~ I saw my man off. Sorrow weighed down my heart ~ To be close to him I wished to be his whip ~ Far or near he rides, I would curl around his arm ~ When he crosses his legs, I would curl around his knees ~ Pasturing my horse in the Twin Spring Marsh ~ I was a fool to forget to tie its feet ~ Shouldering the saddle I chased my pony ~ When would you stop and be a fine steed ~ I rode till I laid my eyes on River Mengjin ~ Poplars and willows lined its banks, whirling and dancing ~ In a southern tongue I heard someone singing ~ This Xianbei herdsman could not fathom its meaning ~ A valiant man calls for a swift horse ~ A swift horse calls for a valiant master ~ Hero or coward?

The couple was murdered last August in the Pamir mountains on their cross-continent trip. Today when turning the pages of Classic of Poetry 詩經, this short poem 《黃鳥》 came to my eyes. It was an elegy for the three brothers (子車奄息，子車仲行，子車鍼虎) of Ziju 子車 clan in Qin state 秦國, who were all celebrated warriors. When their lord - Duke Mu 秦穆公 - died in 621 BC, the three brothers were slain as human sacrifices so they could guard the dead duke in his afterlife. In their life time the men were popular among the martial people of Qin, who admired their strength and courage greatly. Songs were written in memory of them and this particular one was later colleced into the book. Four hundred years after their death, Emperor Qin Shihuang 秦始皇, Duke Mu’s descendant, guarded his own mausoleum with a terracotta army instead of real warriors. I dedicate this translation to the two short yet enriched lives - Jay Austin and Lauren Geoghegan.

Pottage and rice were both cooked and ready, Yet with who I’d share them in this yard all empty?

Here at the foot of Dabie were only hills, villages, sky, water and night stars - simple things that calm the nerves. Nature brings the better side out of humanity. When passing through a village called 周家灣 I witnessed the production of a local handmade noodle called 油麵 （literally, Oil Noodle, a specialty noodle in 團风、羅田、英山、麻城、黃陂、武穴）. To be exact I only saw the final stages of the process - drying and packaging. Impressive. The fine noodles on the shelves - slightly pale instead of bright white because of the rapeseed oil in it - swayed in the breeze like a delicate pearl curtain. The friendly father and son told me about their work with implicit pride. Made with flour, water, salt and a little rapeseed oil, the dough is first painstakingly hand-rubbed into thick strips, and is then elongated/pulled by pairs of extra-long chopsticks for multiple times into thinner threads. Then the chopsticks are attached to the wooden shelves where the noodles are pulled by its own weight into even finer threads and are air-dried outdoors in fine days. Extra work is needed to separate the noodle threads during the drying process. The dry noodles are then neatly packed into rolls, tied up with a red string. It used to be a celebration food, they told me, often presented as gifts for weddings and childbirths. Now many elderly people in this part of Hubei still enjoy the noodle at home for its unparalleled flavour and texture - the fine noodle is smooth as silk, fragrant and delicious in a chicken or pork broth (I can testify on this). No cheap machine-made noodles can compete that - why it survived. I bought 10 yuan of noodles from them, about 1 kilo. The price is rather low for a handmade noodle, but this is central China’s countryside. I wished them good luck sincerely. The noodle felt heavy in the pannier, but remained intact for the 100 km way back. I made a chicken broth and soaked cooked noodle into the broth - a hearty Chicken Broth Noodles 鸡汤麵! The noodle was so silky. Mum praised highly of it. I really wished I had brought back 5 kilo more.

This marketing move caused a small buzz across social networks severe enough for the bookstore to issue an online apology the next day, saying it had abandoned the plan which “shows a lacking of respect to the late authors and also hurts the feeling of the readers.” I visited the “Librairie Avant-grade” 先鋒書店 four years ago and liked it. Its decoration and layout had a touch of seriousness as close to religious faith as a bookstore can get. They had a high quality collection of books of humanity, arts and social science. I bought Dmitry Merezhkovsky’s Napoleon: A Study there, which proved to be the best biography and in-depth study of the emperor I have come across. (Yes, the best Napoleon study, from a Russian writer.) One of their special services was that they offered to put a store stamp on the back of your purchased books - a nostalgic tradition that not many bookstores care to practice nowadays. Personally I think the abandoned plan would have been a campaign that missed the point badly: suicide itself, not the variety of authors who committed it, is a worthy category/subject. As Camus put it, “there is but one really serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.” Librairie Avant-grade in 2015 The bookstore’s intention might be to highlight the weight of “suicide” as a universal theme among great minds. But simply putting up a shelf of books - not by those who thought about it, talked about it and wrote about it but by those who committed it for various reasons - would have defeated the purpose, if ever there is one. My feelings are not hurt at all (how silly such claims sound). On the contrary I have an amusing visualization of such a “suicide authors shelf” scenario: 午夜，當書店陷入黑暗寂靜中時，作者的靈魂紛紛從封面走下來，在書架間彼此問候傾談幾句，或是在角落裡打哈欠抽煙發呆，阿嘉莎問問隔壁道爾爵士的研究新進展，納博科夫向塞林格打聽康尼什小鎮的蝴蝶萍蹤，唯有一處書架下聚了一群人默不作聲像是在賭氣，定睛一看有腦袋纏繃帶的梵古、悶頭擦獵槍的大鬍子海明威、手捧大卵石峨冠往下滴著水的屈原大夫，還有好些穿著上世紀六十年代灰藍布制服、口袋別著鋼筆的老先生。一轉身遇見茨威格，圓眼鏡氣得直閃光：“這叫一個亂！剛才我可遇著希特勒了——誰把《我的奮鬥》塞這兒來了？”","categories":[{"name":"Yangtze","slug":"Yangtze","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/categories/Yangtze/"}],"tags":[{"name":"bookstore","slug":"bookstore","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/tags/bookstore/"},{"name":"suicide","slug":"suicide","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/tags/suicide/"},{"name":"Nanjing","slug":"Nanjing","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/tags/Nanjing/"},{"name":"Librairie Avant-grade","slug":"Librairie-Avant-grade","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/tags/Librairie-Avant-grade/"}]},{"title":"Ode to State's Fallen Warriors 《楚辭•九歌·國殤》英譯","slug":"Ode-state-warrior","date":"2019-05-29T08:06:24.000Z","updated":"2019-10-15T15:29:12.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/05/29/Ode-state-warrior/","link":"","permalink":"https://onsaddle.github.io/2019/05/29/Ode-state-warrior/","excerpt":"","text":"Ode to State’s Fallen Warriors Nine Odes, Songs of ChuQu Yuan (340-278 BC) Wielding dagger-axes from Wu placeWearing armors made of rhino hideWarriors drove the chariots across the enemy’sEngaging them hand to hand Banners blocking the sunEnemy swarmed like cloudsUnder pouring rain of arrowsChu warriors rushed to confront their foes Our formation was brokenOur line was penetratedThe left horse was killedThe right horse was wounded by blades Wheels trapped among corpsesHorses dragged unmovableYet they raised high the jade drum sticksAnd the sound of battle drum burst out loud The heaven was darkenedThe earth roaring in rampageThe last warriors fell to the groundMen’s bodies littered the land after brutal fight Leaving home, they had no intent to returnMarching forward, they rode towards certain deathEndless plain they marched acrossThe land so vast, the journey so long Only the longest sword a true warrior carriesThe strongest bow he drawsEven when his head and body lie in different placesHis soul can not be bent A candid, fearless and martial people we areStrong to the end.

Everything here on earth is in a continual flux which allows nothing to assume any constant form …… It is only when I am alone that I am my own master, at all other times I am the plaything of all who surround me.” explained Rousseau in his Reveries of the Solitary Walker. Around the time of the long-lasting movement, like cycling and distance running, the changes in landscape and the impermanence of myself cancel each other. The momentariness assumes a constant form at last. Thus, happiness becomes possible. Camping night is the rare time when I sleep very early and very sound. Waking up in the middle of the night in a three-foot-thick, dense chorus of frogs, I opened my eyes. Above me were ten thousand shining eyes. Through the universe and the darkness of the mountains, which now have became one, they silently watched me. Stunned beyond words. Some of them may have already gone out. Everything we see is not the present moment, but the way the world was before the photons set off. On a distant planet, at this moment, there may also be a camper, looking at our past.

可惜的是我使勁做手勢找他們要電子郵箱或者FB用戶名，一家人都面面相覷不知所云。當所有努力都宣告溝通失敗之後，我只好給他們一個大大的笑臉再上路。 其實看著大叔的大肚子，眼前出現了很久遠的、幾乎黑白的畫面： 小時候的夏天傍晚，我們一家五口人去江邊的大橋下頭乘涼玩水。也是一個外婆，一對夫妻，一對姐弟。
