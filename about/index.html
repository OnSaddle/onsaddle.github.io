<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, a swordsman from the Chu 楚 state was traveling on the Yangtze in a skiff. </p>
<br>


<p>Yangtze could be tranquil as a pond while at times fierce as the raging ocean. One day his sword fell overboard and disappeared into the muddy rapids. </p>
<br>

<p>To save his treasured companion the swordsman swiftly notched the skiff with a knife to mark the position where the sword had fell. When he finally managed to stablize and stop the boat, he dived right at the position of the notch to salvage his sword.</p>
<br>

<p>His efforts were in vain after all. Yangtze had carried the skiff away since he carved the notch. The sword was now with Yangtze forever.</p>
<br>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Notching Skiff to Retrieve Sword</em></strong> (刻舟求劍 kè zhōu qiú jiàn) is a story from <strong><em>Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals 呂氏春秋</em></strong> . It has been told so many times over the centuries that eventually, it became an idiom in the Chinese language for describing the ill-fated efforts by dim-witted people. </p>
<p>I have a different understanding. </p>
<p><em>Notching Skiff to Retrieve Sword</em> is a story about life and loss.</p>
<p>At some point in our life, things we treasured are bound to be lost, like being taken away by the Yangtze, and never to re-emerge. </p>
<p>What is lost in time is lost. Notching our skiff is perhaps the best way to remember it.</p>
<p>Life is only meaningful thanks to memory. Through memory we travel upstream the river of time and relive the past, diving again and again into the moments that once shined vivid and bright. </p>
<p>In a sense, as long as we can remember them, they are not totally gone.</p>
<p>Memory, or notching the skiff, is the ONLY means to “retrieve” the lost sword.</p>

<p>Nine-dragon Well, 九龍井, was an old well in Wuchang. Back in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) it was a well with an elaborate relief of nine dragons carved on its surface, situated inside the rear garden of the magnificent palace of Imperial Prince Chu 楚王, who governed his vast fief from here.</p>
<p><img src="https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/664e2a23d9c307b7e964099a.png" alt="Firefox_Screenshot_2024-05-22T17-21-49.220Z"></p>
<p>In 1643, the last Prince Chu was executed by rebels. The palace was sacked and then burnt to the ground. Nine-dragon Well was probably one of the few things that survived the turmoil. In the centuries that followed, a namesake settlement flourished around the well. Nine-dragon Well continued to exist as an old, quiet neighbourhood in central Wuchang at the foot of Snake Hill 蛇山.</p>
<p>From 1991 to 1998 I spent most of my teenage years in this neighbourhood. I went to Nine-dragon Well Primary School. All my friends and most classmates lived here too. Day and night we made its streets, parks and the maze of small alleys our playground. </p>
<p>I attended junior high at a place two hundred metres away from it. My senior high was further one mile away. Then I went to college, thousands of miles away, in a coastal province. Then I found a job in Beijing. My adult life mostly took place elsewhere, and my parents moved out of the old neighbourhood in 2002. But it remained as a witness to my past and many cherished memories. </p>
<p>But modern urbanisation finally caught up with old Wuchang. While I was away many old residential buildings were bulldozed and redeveloped. A major city arterial road was constructed right through the middle of the neighbourhood. A metro line was constructed and a metro station named 彭劉楊 was built at the heart of the Nine-dragon Well. The old well itself was now covered by structures.</p>
<p>I dedicate this tiny cyberspace to you, 九龍井.</p>
