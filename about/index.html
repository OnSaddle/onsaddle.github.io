<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, a swordsman from the Chu state was traveling on the Yangtze in a skiff. </p>
<br>


<p>Yangtze could be tranquil as a pond while at times fierce as the raging ocean. One day his sword fell overboard and disappeared into the muddy rapids. </p>
<br>

<p>To save his treasured companion the swordsman swiftly notched the skiff with a knife to mark the position where the sword had fell. When he finally managed to stablize and stop the boat, he dived right at the position of the notch to salvage his sword.</p>
<br>

<p>His efforts were in vain after all. Yangtze had carried the skiff away since he carved the notch. The sword was now with Yangtze forever.</p>
<br>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Notching Skiff to Retrieve Sword</em></strong> (刻舟求劍 kè zhōu qiú jiàn) is a story from <strong><em>Master Lü’s Spring and Autumn Annals 呂氏春秋</em></strong> . It has been told so many times over the centuries that eventually, it became an idiom in the Chinese language for describing the ill-fated efforts by dim-witted people. </p>
<p>I have a different understanding. </p>
<p><em>Notching Skiff to Retrieve Sword</em> is a story about life and loss.</p>
<p>At some point in our life, things we treasured are bound to be lost, like being taken away by the Yangtze, and never to re-emerge. </p>
<p>What is lost in time is lost. Notching our skiff is perhaps the best way to remember it.</p>
<p>Life is only meaningful thanks to memory. Through memory we travel upstream the river of time and relive the past, diving again and again into the moments that once shined vivid and bright. </p>
<p>In a sense, as long as we can remember them, they are not totally gone.</p>
<p>Memory, or notching the skiff, is the ONLY means to “retrieve” the lost sword.</p>

<p>Nine-dragon Well, 九龍井, was an old well in Wuchang. Back in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) it was a well with an elaborate relief of nine dragons carved on its surface, situated inside the rear garden of the palace of Imperial Prince Chu 楚王, who governed his vast fiefdom from there.</p>
<p><img src="https://pic.imgdb.cn/item/664e2a23d9c307b7e964099a.png" alt="Firefox_Screenshot_2024-05-22T17-21-49.220Z"></p>
<p>In 1643, the last Prince Chu was executed by rebels. The palace was sacked and then burnt to the ground. Nine-dragon Well was probably one of the few things that survived the turmoil. In the centuries that followed, a namesake settlement appeared around it. At some point in the 20th century the old well itself was cleared and covered by structures, but 九龍井 continued to exist as an old, quiet neighbourhood in central Wuchang.</p>
<p>It’s where I grew up in the 1990s. This blog is named after it.</p>
